Version 2: Made track be Reversable ( needed to adjust a few polygons for it ),
           Added more trees,
           Changed the texture of the sand, so it would get dark away from the track,
           Adjusted the AI trackline in one place ( they were hitting the wall in the same place ).
           
Version 3:
	Players requested more checklines to avoid cheating. I added a few more.
	
	On lowest setting the map looked too boring. And even on the highest
	settings the white part of the road didn't look that good. It was too bright.
	So I baked a lightmap for the whole road. Now even on the lowest graphics
	it looks kind of decent.
	
	I reduced the brightness of a few texutes, to look a bit more like in the movie.
	And in a few textures changes the saturation too.
	
	In one place I fixed a polygon that was showing through the road.
	
Verson 4:
	Added custom music based on Moria's Race movie soundtrack.
